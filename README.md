Project
🚀 Just completed a responsive university website using HTML and CSS! 🎓💻

I recently designed and developed a responsive university website that looks great on all devices — desktops, tablets, and smartphones! This project allowed me to apply key web development concepts, including:

✅ HTML5 for a clean and structured layout
✅ CSS3 for styling and visual design
✅ Responsive Design with media queries to ensure accessibility on different screen sizes

🔹 Features of the Website:

📌 Homepage with a dynamic hero section
📚 Programs Page showcasing available courses
📝 Admissions Page with application details
📞 Contact Form for inquiries
🌐 Fully responsive navigation bar
This project helped me strengthen my skills in UI/UX design principles and frontend development. I also focused on ensuring good user experience and accessibility standards.

I’m excited to keep building and learning more in web development! 🌟


Would love to hear your feedback! 😊
